## How to Submit Your Project

Want your open source project reviewed on stream? Here's how:

1. **Navigate to the Submit Project page** and fill out the form with:

   - **Project Name**: A clear, descriptive name (3-50 characters)
   - **GitHub Repository URL**: Must be a public repository hosted on GitHub
   - **Project Description**: A brief description that helps during the review

2. **Submit your project** - Once submitted, your project enters the pool for random selection.

3. **Wait for selection** - Projects are picked randomly for each livestream (see below).

**Note**: Each project can only be submitted once per review cycle. If your project has already been submitted, you'll see a notification.

## Random Project Selection

Projects are selected **randomly** for each livestream using "The Orc Machine" - our random project picker. Here's how it works:

- All submitted projects enter a pool
- Before each stream, projects are randomly selected from the pool
- Selected projects are reviewed during the livestream
- After review, projects are archived by batch

This ensures a fair and unbiased selection process, giving every submitted project an equal chance to be featured.

## Reviewed Projects

After projects are reviewed on stream, they're archived and organized by batch. You can view all previously reviewed projects on the [Reviewed Projects](https://review.orcdev.com/reviewed-projects) page, where each batch is linked to its corresponding livestream.
